A computer engineer at heart, my experiences in the Smart City of Singapore fascinated me. While I spent my days working on multi-disciplinary projects at NTU and at AMD, I fell in love with Singapore... and cities. Moreover, having grown up in the expansive financial capital of Mumbai, the Urban Science industry was just the fit for me, combining my passion for technology with application to improve lives.

I demonstrate my skills and passion through taking on various urban-science projects with the overall aim of achieving the best of human health, experience, accessibility and habitat for the community as a whole.
